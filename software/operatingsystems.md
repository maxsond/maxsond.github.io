*UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity. - Dennis Ritchie*

I also find the high-level design of operating systems pretty interesting. This started with 
[this excellent course](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-operating-systems--ud923) from Georgia Tech.

Even if you don't really care about operating systems, I recommend this particular course on the same grounds as [I recommend Nand 2 Tetris](/hardware/#n2t):
it's about more than the technical details. There are patterns at work that apply across disciplines.
