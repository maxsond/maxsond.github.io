*What one fool can do, another can. - Silvanus Phillips Thompson*

Growing up, I always saw hardware as an impenetrable mystery reserved for the high machine priests.
However, I found a course that demystified that most mystical of hardware creatures: the CPU.
What's even better, the course is free to all and requires absolutely no prior knowledge.

Welcome to <a name="n2t">[Nand 2 Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)</a>! To be fair, it is designed to
be the most simple introduction possible, so this is not going to make you understand
modern hardware architecture. But it's a great start. Even if you don't care at all
about hardware, it gets you thinking about complex systems as merely layers of simple
systems, and that's a valuable skill unto itself.
