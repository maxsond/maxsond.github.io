*I was very slow in maths, geometry I actually enjoyed. - Liam Neeson*

For my part, I'm a big fan of geometry (the mathematically advanced may notice the title of this site is a geometry pun). I like that it can represent mathematical concepts like Pythagoras' theorem. 
A geometry game of sorts that I'm really into right now is [Euclidea](http://euclidea.xyz), which gives you the tools to explore geometry 
on your computer or mobile device.
